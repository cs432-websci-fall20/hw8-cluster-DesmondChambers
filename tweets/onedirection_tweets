I love…
And now I'm one step closer to being two steps far from you, when everybody wants you, everybody wants you 

#8YearsofOneDirection
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea, maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep 

#8YearsofOneDirection
We can make it 'til the end, nothing can come between you and I 

#8YearsofOneDirection
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down, and if you like going places we can't even pronounce 

#8YearsofOneDirection
Everybody wanna steal my girl, everybody wanna take her heart away 

#8YearsofOneDirection
I've been thinking about it lately, does it ever drive you crazy, just how fast the night changes? 

#8YearsofOneDirection
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love and never, never, never stop for anyone 

#8YearsofOneDirection
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah and let me kiss you! 

#8YearsofOneDirection

But now we're together we're alone, and there's no other place I'd ever wanna go 

#8YearsofOneDirection
The story of my life, I take her home, I drive all night to keep her warm

Baby you light up my world like nobody else 

#8YearsofOneDirection

I'm half a man at best, with half an arrow in my chest 

#8YearsofOneDirection
In the heat where you lay, I could stay right here and burn in it all day 

#8YearsofOneDirection
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun, you taught me how to be someone 

#8YearsofOneDirection
We knew every line now I can't remember, how it goes but I know that I won't forget her 

#8YearsofOneDirection
Baby they don't know about, they don't know about us 

#8YearsofOneDirection
So get out, get out, get out of my head, and fall in to my arms instead 

#8YearsofOneDirection
For your eyes only, I show you my heart, for when you're lonely and forget who you are 

#8YearsofOneDirection
So I built you a house from a broken home and I wrote you a song with the words you spoke 

#8YearsofOneDirection
It's gotta be you, only you. It's gotta be you, only you 

#8YearsofOneDirection
Baby you and me, stumbling in the street, singing, singing, singing, singing! 

#8YearsofOneDirection
And as you close your eyes tonight, I pray that you will see the light, that's shining from the stars above 

#8YearsofOneDirection
You and me got a whole lot of history, we could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen!
